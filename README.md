# Quanah

[Quanah](https://qmachine.github.io/quanah/) is a JavaScript library for
writing concurrent programs in JavaScript that still run correctly in serial
execution environments. [QMachine](https://www.qmachine.org/), for example,
uses Quanah extensively to implement a web service that acts as a supercomputer
that uses web browsers as computational nodes. I am currently writing several
papers about Quanah and applications that use it, but I promise I will write
more [documentation](https://quanah.readthedocs.org) soon!

Because Quanah is written in pure JS, it can be used in both client- and
server-side applications. Thus, this repository integrates with both
[Bower](http://bower.io) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org):

    $ bower install quanah
    $ npm install quanah

Quanah is also available through
[MinervaJS](http://minervajs.org/site/index.html#!/view/quanah).

There are several "mirrors" available on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wilkinson/quanah),
[GitHub](https://github.com/qmachine/quanah), and
[Google Code](https://quanah.googlecode.com). Various project statistics are
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/qmachine/quanah/graphs) and
[Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/p/quanah), too.
