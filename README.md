Quanah
======

[Quanah](http://wilkinson.github.com/quanah) is a JavaScript library for
writing concurrent programs in JavaScript that still run correctly in serial
execution environments. [Qmachine](http://qmachine.org), for example, uses
Quanah to implement a web service that acts as a "supercomputer" for running
scientific computations using only web browsers and
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). I am currently writing several papers
about Quanah and applications that use it, but I promise I will write more
documentation soon!

There are several "mirrors" available on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wilkinson/quanah),
[GitHub](https://github.com/wilkinson/quanah), and
[Google Code](https://quanah.googlecode.com).
