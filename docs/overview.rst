Overview
========

Quanah_ is a model for workflows, and it is so closely related to its original
implementation in JavaScript as to be synonymous. Quanah is the core model that
powers QMachine_ (QM), a web service for distributed computing. QM was detailed
in a recent paper, `QMachine: commodity supercomputing in web browsers
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/176>`_, but Quanah was only briefly
mentioned. This manual is the best reference for Quanah that is currently
available. The main focuses here will be to describe how it works, how to use
it, and how to contribute to the open-source project.
