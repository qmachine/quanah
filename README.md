# Quanah

[Quanah](https://qmachine.github.io/quanah/) is a JavaScript (JS) library for
writing concurrent programs that still run correctly in serial execution
environments. [QMachine](https://www.qmachine.org/), for example, uses Quanah
extensively to build a World Wide Computer that can use web browsers as
computational nodes. Currently, [documentation](https://quanah.readthedocs.org)
is sparse because I am writing several papers and a PhD thesis about Quanah and
applications that use it.

Because Quanah is written in pure JS, it can be used in both client- and
server-side applications. Thus, this repository integrates with both
[Bower](http://bower.io) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org):

    $ bower install quanah
    $ npm install quanah

Quanah is also available through
[MinervaJS](http://minervajs.org/site/index.html#!/view/quanah).

There are several "mirrors" available on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wilkinson/quanah),
[GitHub](https://github.com/qmachine/quanah), and
[Google Code](https://quanah.googlecode.com). Various project statistics are
available on [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/public/qmachine/quanah/dashboard),
[GitHub](https://github.com/qmachine/quanah/graphs) and
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/quanah), too.
