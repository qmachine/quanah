Quanah
======

[Quanah](http://wilkinson.github.com/quanah) is a JavaScript library for
writing concurrent programs in JavaScript that still run correctly in serial
execution environments. [QMachine](https://www.qmachine.org/), for example,
uses Quanah extensively to implement a web service that acts as a supercomputer
that uses web browsers as computational nodes. I am currently writing several
papers about Quanah and applications that use it, but I promise I will write
more documentation soon!

A [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) module can be installed via
[NPM](https://npmjs.org/package/quanah). Quanah is also available in
[Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/).

There are several "mirrors" available on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wilkinson/quanah),
[GitHub](https://github.com/wilkinson/quanah), and
[Google Code](https://quanah.googlecode.com). Various project statistics are
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wilkinson/quanah/graphs) and
[Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/p/quanah), too.
